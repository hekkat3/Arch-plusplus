# Arch++
[STILL IN DEVELOPMENT]

A more complete Arch ISO, with some more tools installed in it, scripts and a guide for manual installation.

It is meant for people who want to learn how to install Arch or for those who want to install it more quickly without having to install an Arch distribution.

## Important notes
Run the 'build_iso.sh' script (which is inside the archlive/ folder) to create the ISO. It's important to run the script from the archlive/ folder.
The ISO is built in a folder (archISO/) that is created in the git directory.
When re-building the ISO the previous ISO will be removed. If you want to keep it move it to another folder or change the script.
